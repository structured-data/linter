      comment: "A 3D model represents some kind of 3D content, which may have [[encoding]]s in one or more [[MediaObject]]s. Many 3D formats are available (e.g. see [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:3D_graphics_file_formats)); specific encoding formats can be represented using the [[encodingFormat]] property applied to the relevant [[MediaObject]]. For the\ncase of a single file published after Zip compression, the convention of appending '+zip' to the [[encodingFormat]] can be used. Geospatial, AR/VR, artistic/animation, gaming, engineering and scientific content can all be represented using [[3DModel]].",

Ideally, a [[Claim]] description includes enough contextual information to minimize the risk of ambiguity or inclarity. In practice, many claims are better understood in the context in which they appear or the interpretations provided by claim reviews.\n\n  Beyond [[ClaimReview]], the Claim type can be associated with related creative works - for example a [[ScholarlyArticle]] or [[Question]] might be [[about]] some [[Claim]].\n\n  At this time, Schema.org does not define any types of relationship between claims.

In each case, the [[hasPart]] / [[isPartOf]] properties can be used to relate the CreativeWorkSeries to its parts. The general CreativeWorkSeries type serves largely just to organize these more specific and practical subtypes.\\n\\nIt is common for properties applicable to an item from the series to be usefully applied to the containing group. Schema.org attempts to anticipate some of these cases, but publishers should be free to apply properties of the series parts to the series as a whole wherever they seem appropriate.\n\t  ",

For example, opinion pieces, reviews, analysis, sponsored or satirical articles, or articles that combine several of these elements.\n\nThe [[ReportageNewsArticle]] type is based on a stricter ideal for \"news\" as a work of journalism, with articles based on factual information either observed or verified by the author, or reported and verified from knowledgeable sources.  This often includes perspectives from multiple viewpoints on a particular issue (distinguishing news reports from public relations or propaganda).  News reports in the [[ReportageNewsArticle]] sense de-emphasize the opinion of the author, with commentary and value judgements typically expressed elsewhere.\n\nA [[ReportageNewsArticle]] which goes deeper into analysis can also be marked with an additional type of [[AnalysisNewsArticle]].\n",

    term :SpecialAnnouncement,
      comment: "A SpecialAnnouncement combines a simple date-stamped textual information update\n      with contextualized Web links and other structured data.  It represents an information update made by a\n      locally-oriented organization, for example schools, pharmacies, healthcare providers,  community groups, police,\n      local government.\n\nFor work in progress guidelines on Coronavirus-related markup see [this doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/14ikaGCKxo50rRM7nvKSlbUpjyIk2WMQd3IkB1lItlrM/edit#).\n\nThe motivating scenario for SpecialAnnouncement is the [Coronavirus pandemic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019%E2%80%9320_coronavirus_pandemic), and the initial vocabulary is oriented to this urgent situation. Schema.org\nexpect to improve the markup iteratively as it is deployed and as feedback emerges from use. In addition to our\nusual [Github entry](https://github.com/schemaorg/schemaorg/issues/2490), feedback comments can also be provided in [this document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1fpdFFxk8s87CWwACs53SGkYv3aafSxz_DTtOQxMrBJQ/edit#).\n\n\nWhile this schema is designed to communicate urgent crisis-related information, it is not the same as an emergency warning technology like [CAP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Alerting_Protocol), although there may be overlaps. The intent is to cover\nthe kinds of everyday practical information being posted to existing websites during an emergency situation.\n\nSeveral kinds of information can be provided:\n\nWe encourage the provision of \"name\", \"text\", \"datePosted\", \"expires\" (if appropriate), \"category\" and\n\"url\" as a simple baseline. It is important to provide a value for \"category\" where possible, most ideally as a well known\nURL from Wikipedia or Wikidata. In the case of the 2019-2020 Coronavirus pandemic, this should be \"https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=2019-20\\_coronavirus\\_pandemic\" or \"https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q81068910\".\n\nFor many of the possible properties, values can either be simple links or an inline description, depending on whether a summary is available. For a link, provide just the URL of the appropriate page as the property's value. For an inline description, use a [[WebContent]] type, and provide the url as a property of that, alongside at least a simple \"[[text]]\" summary of the page. It is\nunlikely that a single SpecialAnnouncement will need all of the possible properties simultaneously.\n\nWe expect that in many cases the page referenced might contain more specialized structured data, e.g. contact info, [[openingHours]], [[Event]], [[FAQPage]] etc. By linking to those pages from a [[SpecialAnnouncement]] you can help make it clearer that the events are related to the situation (e.g. Coronavirus) indicated by the [[category]] property of the [[SpecialAnnouncement]].\n\nMany [[SpecialAnnouncement]]s will relate to particular regions and to identifiable local organizations. Use [[spatialCoverage]] for the region, and [[announcementLocation]] to indicate specific [[LocalBusiness]]es and [[CivicStructure]]s. If the announcement affects both a particular region and a specific location (for example, a library closure that serves an entire region), use both [[spatialCoverage]] and [[announcementLocation]].\n\nThe [[about]] property can be used to indicate entities that are the focus of the announcement. We now recommend using [[about]] only\nfor representing non-location entities (e.g. a [[Course]] or a [[RadioStation]]). For places, use [[announcementLocation]] and [[spatialCoverage]]. Consumers of this markup should be aware that the initial design encouraged the use of [[about]] for locations too.\n\nThe basic content of [[SpecialAnnouncement]] is similar to that of an [RSS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSS) or [Atom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atom_(Web_standard)) feed. For publishers without such feeds, basic feed-like information can be shared by posting\n[[SpecialAnnouncement]] updates in a page, e.g. using JSON-LD. For sites with Atom/RSS functionality, you can point to a feed\nwith the [[webFeed]] property. This can be a simple URL, or an inline [[DataFeed]] object, with [[encodingFormat]] providing\nmedia type information, e.g. \"application/rss+xml\" or \"application/atom+xml\".\n",

Note that the sense of \"population\" used here is the general sense of a statistical\npopulation, and does not imply that the population consists of people. For example, a [[populationType]] of [[Event]] or [[NewsArticle]] could be used. See also [[Observation]], where a [[populationType]] such as [[Person]] or [[Event]] can be indicated directly.

    term :StatisticalVariable,
      comment: "[[StatisticalVariable]] represents any type of statistical metric that can be measured at a place and time. The usage pattern for [[StatisticalVariable]] is typically expressed using [[Observation]] with an explicit [[populationType]], which is a type, typically drawn from Schema.org. Each [[StatisticalVariable]] is marked as a [[ConstraintNode]], meaning that some properties (those listed using [[constraintProperty]]) serve in this setting solely to define the statistical variable rather than literally describe a specific person, place or thing. For example, a [[StatisticalVariable]] Median_Height_Person_Female representing the median height of women, could be written as follows: the population type is [[Person]]; the measuredProperty [[height]]; the [[statType]] [[median]]; the [[gender]] [[Female]]. It is important to note that there are many kinds of scientific quantitative observation which are not fully, perfectly or unambiguously described following this pattern, or with solely Schema.org terminology. The approach taken here is designed to allow partial, incremental or minimal description of [[StatisticalVariable]]s, and the use of detailed sets of entity and property IDs from external repositories. The [[measurementMethod]], [[unitCode]] and [[unitText]] properties can also be used to clarify the specific nature and notation of an observed measurement. ",

      comment: "Anatomical features that can be observed by sight (without dissection), including the form and proportions of the human body as well as surface landmarks that correspond to deeper subcutaneous structures. Superficial anatomy plays an important role in sports medicine, phlebotomy, and other medical specialties as underlying anatomical structures can be identified through surface palpation. For example, during back surgery, superficial anatomy can be used to palpate and count vertebrae to find the site of incision. Or in phlebotomy, superficial anatomy can be used to locate an underlying vein; for example, the median cubital vein can be located by palpating the borders of the cubital fossa (such as the epicondyles of the humerus) and then looking for the superficial signs of the vein, such as size, prominence, ability to refill after depression, and feel of surrounding tissue support. As another example, in a subluxation (dislocation) of the glenohumeral joint, the bony structure becomes pronounced with the deltoid muscle failing to cover the glenohumeral joint allowing the edges of the scapula to be superficially visible. Here, the superficial anatomy is the visible edges of the scapula, implying the underlying dislocation of the joint (the related anatomical structure).",

Often but not necessarily each [[variableMeasured]] will have an explicit representation as (or mapping to) an property such as those defined in Schema.org, or other RDF vocabularies and \"knowledge graphs\". In that case the subproperty of [[variableMeasured]] called [[measuredProperty]] is applicable.\n    \nThe [[measurementTechnique]] property helps when extra clarification is needed about how a [[measuredProperty]] was measured. This is oriented towards scientific and scholarly dataset publication but may have broader applicability; it is not intended as a full representation of measurement, but can often serve as a high level summary for dataset discovery. \n\nFor example, if [[variableMeasured]] is: molecule concentration, [[measurementTechnique]] could be: \"mass spectrometry\" or \"nmr spectroscopy\" or \"colorimetry\" or \"immunofluorescence\". If the [[variableMeasured]] is \"depression rating\", the [[measurementTechnique]] could be \"Zung Scale\" or \"HAM-D\" or \"Beck Depression Inventory\". \n\nIf there are several [[variableMeasured]] properties recorded for some given data object, use a [[PropertyValue]] for each [[variableMeasured]] and attach the corresponding [[measurementTechnique]]. The value can also be from an enumeration, organized as a [[MeasurementMetholdEnumeration]].",

The general trend in web technology is towards [responsive design](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Responsive_web_design) in which content can be flexibly adapted to a wide range of browsing environments. Pages and sites referenced with the long-established [[url]] property should ideally also be usable on a wide variety of devices, including mobile phones. In most cases, it would be pointless and counter productive to attempt to update all [[url]] markup to use [[mobileUrl]] for more mobile-oriented pages. The property is intended for the case when items (primarily [[Product]] and [[Offer]]) have extra URLs hosted on an additional \"mobile site\" alongside the main one.

The simplest use of *speakable* has (potentially relative) URL values, referencing identified sections of the document concerned.\n\n2.) CSS Selectors - addresses content in the annotated page, e.g. via class attribute. Use the [[cssSelector]] property.\n\n3.)  XPaths - addresses content via XPaths (assuming an XML view of the content). Use the [[xpath]] property.\n\n\nFor more sophisticated markup of speakable sections beyond simple ID references, either CSS selectors or XPath expressions to pick out document section(s) as speakable. For this\nwe define a supporting type, [[SpeakableSpecification]]  which is defined to be a possible value of the *speakable* property.\n         ",

In\n      the case of a Dataset it will typically indicate the relevant time period in a precise notation (e.g. for a 2011 census dataset, the year 2011 would be written \"2011/2012\"). Other forms of content, e.g. ScholarlyArticle, Book, TVSeries or TVEpisode, may indicate their temporalCoverage in broader terms - textually or via well-known URL.\n      Written works such as books may sometimes have precise temporal coverage too, e.g. a work set in 1939 - 1945 can be indicated in ISO 8601 interval format format via \"1939/1945\".\n\nOpen-ended date ranges can be written with \"..\" in place of the end date. For example, \"2015-11/..\" indicates a range beginning in November 2015 and with no specified final date. This is tentative and might be updated in future when ISO 8601 is officially updated.",
