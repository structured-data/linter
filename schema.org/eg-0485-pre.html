Example of a certification for carbon footprint of a product with a W3C verifiable
credential (https://w3c.github.io/vc-data-model). The certification information is copied
and embedded within the Product.

Note the use of id and type instead of @id and @type, using the mappings defined in
https://www.w3.org/ns/credentials/v2, for lighter-weight credential-type specific processing.
