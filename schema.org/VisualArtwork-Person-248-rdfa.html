        <p>
            A <span property="artform">painting</span> also known as 
            <span>The Treason of Images</span> or 
            <span property="alternateName">The Treachery of Images</span>.

                The painting shows a pipe. Below it, Magritte painted, 
                <q lang="fr">Ceci n'est pas une pipe.</q>, French for 
                "This is not a pipe."
            </p>
            <p>
                His statement is taken to mean that the painting itself is not a pipe. 
                The painting is merely an image of a pipe. Hence, the description, 
                "this is not a pipe."
            </p>
            <p>
                Similarly, the image shown above is neither a pipe nor even a painting, 
                but rather a digital photograph.
            </p>
            <p>
                The painting is sometimes given as an example of meta message conveyed 
                by paralanguage. Compare with Korzybski's <q>The word is not the thing</q> 
                and <q>The map is not the territory</q>.
