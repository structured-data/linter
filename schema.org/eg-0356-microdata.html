      <p itemprop="description">For most people, the primary reason to purchase life insurance is to help provide for dependents in the case of your death and the resulting loss of income. To determine a coverage amount, estimate what your family members would need after you’re gone to meet immediate, ongoing, and future financial obligations including funeral, rent or mortgage, other every day bills, college, and retirement.</p>
